# Writing and Understanding AutoPkg Recipes
This repo has the source files from my presentation at the 2019 MacTech Conference as well as a copy of the slides (with live links).

## Source Files
Within the recipes directory, [ClipGrab_initial_new-recipe](https://github.com/jazzace/mactech-2019-autopkg/tree/master/recipes/ClipGrab_initial_new-recipe) contains the unedited files created by the `autopkg new-recipe` commands shown in the presentation. The finished product is shown in [the ClipGrab.org directory.](https://github.com/jazzace/mactech-2019-autopkg/tree/master/recipes/ClipGrab.org)

Since there's a lot of code on the slides, you can either examine the code on the slides themselves (see below) or use these links to get the source (in order of appearance):
